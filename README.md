# Runic Repository

**Runic Repository** is a Minecraft mod (NeoForge 1.21.1) that introduces a **magical storage system** inspired by popular tech-style mods such as Applied Energistics 2, but with an arcane twist. Instead of cables and digital storage disks, players will use **runes**, **tomes**, and **mana** to store and access items across their world.

## **Features**

- **Arcane Ash**: A basic crafting component and fuel source for the mod’s magic-powered machines.
- **Library Core**: The “brain” block that manages your magical storage network.
- **Tome Shelf**: Holds specialized **Storage Tomes** that store items.
- **Runic Lectern**: Provides a user interface to view and manage all items in the network.
- **Runic Chalk**: Used to create runic links between blocks—no cables required!

## **Goals & Roadmap**

1. **Early-Game Accessibility**
    - Provide a simple entry point to magical storage, accessible even in early to mid-game.
2. **Scalability & Mana Management**
    - Encourage progression by tying storage expansion to mana consumption.
3. **Immersive Magical Aesthetic**
    - Replace mechanical or digital visuals with a library theme—books, shelves, lecterns, runes, and mana.

## **Planned Features**

- **Arcane Generator / Mana Production**
    - A source of mana that powers the entire network.
- **Crafting Automation**
    - Automated crafting using runic connections and specialized “magic benches.”
- **Multiple Storage Tiers**
    - Higher-tier tomes for large-scale storage.
- **Rune-Based Connections**
    - A unique, lore-friendly alternative to cables. Draw magic runes on the ground to link blocks within range.
